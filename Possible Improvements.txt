*Improvements*

There is a lot of space for improvement in this project.
Here are some of them:

1. Output shown in the "get" method can be improved.
2. "/inputs" route can be displayed with more sophisticated tables.
3. Database structure can also be improved with better design.
4. "Requirement.txt" is currently a large file which can be reduced to only important libraries.
